To add custom plugins, navigate to **Settings/Sigmacord Settings**. Scroll down until you locate the **folders** section, which includes the **Plugins folder** and **Themes folder**. Click the black folder button to access the respective folders, typically found in **C:/Users/user/sigmacord/**.

For new plugins, create a new folder with a custom name within the Plugins folder and place the plugin files inside it. If the plugin already comes in a folder, paste the entire folder, ensuring there are no nested folders within the plugin folder.

The process for adding new themes is identical to adding plugins. Once added, you'll find your themes listed in the Sigmacord settings under the **Theme** dropdown menu. Select your desired theme, scroll down, and click the "Save and Restart" button.
